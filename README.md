# Paraphernalia 
Paraphernalia is a collection of utility scripts we use when we make stuff. We got tired of copying and pasting stuff from old projects and hunting things down on the Unify Community, so we organized them into folders, namespaced stuff, and put them in a git repo so we could just add them as a submodule when we start new projects. Everything is licensed under MIT with permission from the authors. We've done our best to document who did what. Enjoy.
